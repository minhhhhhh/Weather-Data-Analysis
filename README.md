# Weather Data Analysis

This project analyzes historical weather data to identify patterns, visualize trends, and perform statistical analysis. It leverages Python libraries for data extraction, processing, and visualization.

---

## Features

- **Data Extraction:** Unzips and processes weather data from `.dly` files.
- **Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for generating insightful graphs.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Employs NumPy for numerical operations on weather datasets.
- **Dynamic File Handling:** Processes multiple weather station files dynamically.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Weather_Data_Analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. Ensure the following data files are available:
   - `weather.zip` (contains `.dly` files and additional metadata)
   - `stations.txt` (optional: contains station information)

---

## Usage

1. Extract the weather data by unzipping the provided file:
   ```python
   import zipfile
   zipfile.ZipFile('weather.zip').extractall('.')
   ```

2. Run the notebook to process and analyze the data:
   - Visualize trends like temperature variations.
   - Perform statistical computations on datasets.

3. Modify code blocks to customize file paths or analysis parameters as needed.
